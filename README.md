cypher-queries
==============

Neo4j Cypher queries I've written that might be useful later.

### In other projects ###
####[StoryViz character model](https://github.com/StoryViz/StoryViz/blob/master/models/character_model.js)####
Queries supporting the StoryViz web app. Insertion, relation and retrieval of characters and relationships in a story. The graph structure is built around the notion of chapter nodes, allowing queries to show changes in those characters and relationships over time.
